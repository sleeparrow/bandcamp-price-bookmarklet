# Bandcamp Price Bookmarklet

This is a Chrome bookmarklet that does the following on a Bandcamp album page:

- Calculates the length of the album
- Suggests how much you should pay for the album (configurable)
- Appends this info. to the album description under the track listing

This certainly doesn't _need_ to be a Chrome bookmarklet, but I wrote this for
me and only tested it in Chrome. Who knows; maybe it works in other browsers.
Please feel free to adapt it to be a cross-browser bookmarklet. Pull requests
are gratefully accepted.
